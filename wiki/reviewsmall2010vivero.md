# Summary of "Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for Intracellular Controlled Drug Delivery"
## Introduction

The review focuses on the most recent *(2010)* progress in the application of mesopourus silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for intracellular drug delivery. One of the key challenges of the drug delivery systems is to transport an effective amount of drug with fewer acute and chronic side effects than those of the current treatment methods,  such as chemotherapy. To achive this, the delivery carriers must meet some prerequisites:

- **The vehicle should be biocompatible**    
- **High loading and protection of the guest molecule**  
- **Zero premature release before reaching its target**   
- **Efficient cellular uptake**    
- **Effective endosomal escape**     
- **Controllable rate of release to achieve an effective local concentration**    
- **Cell and tissue targeting**    	

## Intracellular Uptake

"The most important barrier to overcome for intracellular drug delivery carriers is the cell membrane. Thorough under-standing of the pathways for the cellular internalization of MSNs is a central challenge for many of its  applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.(...) Depending on the size of the particles to be engulfed, the  cells can use any of these internalization processes. Specialized cells such as macrophage use phago-cytosis to  engulf microscale particles (> 1 μm). On the other hand, the cellular uptake of small particles (< 200–300 nm) such as MSNs, polymers, quantum dots, or carbon nanotubes is found to involve endocytosis for the majority of cases."

"Endocytosis is a very complex process that consists of the interaction at the cell surface, invagination and  pinching-off, and finally tethering the newly formed vesicles to the next stop in the intracellular trafficking  process. **So far, there is no “rule of thumb” to predict which endocytic pathway that either MSN or  functionalized MSN materials will follow when they are internalized by cells.** Understanding and controlling the  internalization pathway is of utmost importance in the development of drug delivery platforms."

### Intracellular Uptake of MSNs into Mammalian Cells 

Some experiments were run on a Chinese hamster ovarian and on human pancreatic cells and it was determined that:

- It is **concentration-dependent** and follows a sigmoidal behavior of dose-response endocytosis
- It is **higher at 37°C than at 4°C**
- There's a series of metabolic inhibitors, including sodium azide (which depletes intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP)), sucrose (which suppresses coated pit function), bafilomycin A (which inhibits v-ATPase function), and nonacadazole (which reduces microtubule network), that suppress the internalization of MSNs into  human pancreatic cells (PANC-1). 
- The **size limits** for internalization of nanoparticles through endocytosis are clearly cell-dependent but particles less than 200 nm in size will follow mainly endocytic pathways; nanoparticles above this size can be either engulfed through endocytosis or not internalized at all; and microsized particles have to be internalized by phagocytic pathways. However, it was found that a **diameter of 50 nm is the optimal size** to achieve the most efficient endocytosis.
- They found a correlation between the positive charge of MSNs and internalization into 3T3-L1 cells but not on other cell-types so the **surface charge effect could also be cell-type-dependent**.
- The internalization of nanospheres was more efficient because it takes a shorter time to wrap a sphere than an entire rod due to the **increase in the surface area**.

## Intracellular Trafficking

"The internalization of these materials was followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using an endosome  marker. **It was determined that more negatively charged MSN materials are able to escape from endosomes,  while  positively  charged  MSNs  remained  trapped  within  endosomes.** These observations were explained based on  the surface charge reversal that MSNs undergo due to the transfer of protons from the bulk solution to the  surface of the material under acidic conditions, better known as “proton sponge effect.” "

## Cell Targeting

"The combination of drug delivery and cell targeting to specific cell/tissue populations is a key issue nowadays in biomedical science. Especially in cases such as cancer therapies, where the antitumor drugs lack of target specificity results in adverse side effects and limited effectiveness due to unspecific action on healthy cells."

Different strategies could be used for cell targeting, the specifics of which will not be detailed in this summary. However, despite all these promising strategies have been demonstrated in vitro, **the application of target-specific MSNs vehicles in vivo has not yet been reported.** 

## Biocompatibility 

"Despite the great potential that MSNs show for biomedical applications, **our knowledge of the toxicological effects in vivo is still very limited**. This may be because many features can act as potentially toxic  triggers such as concentration, surface area and size distribution, chemical composition, surface structure, solubility, shape, and aggregation.   
The biocompatibility of MSNs in vitro is **concentration-dependent** and has been thoroughly studied in different  cell lines. For instance, MSN materials are biocompatible toward HeLa (human cervical cancer) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovarian) at concentrations below 100 μg mL^(− 1). Increasing the MSNs concentration (above 200 μg mL^(− 1)) resulted in cell damage." 

"The structural properties of MSNs can affect their biocompatibility. In a study, the hemolytic properties of MSNs toward mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) were described. A highly ordered MSN material was synthesized, and  its structural and hemolytic properties were compared with commercially available amorphous silica material. The  hemolytic properties of these two materials were tested at different concentrations (20–100 μg mL^(− 1)), it  was determined that **MSNs are nontoxic toward RBCs**; on the contrary, amorphous silica induced a high degree of  hemolysis confirming previous reports. To account for this performance, it was hypothesized that the strong  electrostatic interaction between the continuous surface silanol groups in the amorphous silica material is the  reason for its hemolytic properties. Conversely, MSNs contain most silanol groups inside the mesochannels  protecting them from interaction with RBCs.  Moreover, the external surface of MSNs is discontinuous because of  the mesoporosity, which results in a low hemolytic behavior. This report illustrated that contrary to the  cytotoxicity of amorphous silica toward RBCs, **MSNs showed a high biocompatibility at the  concentrations  evaluated**."   

" In fact, Haynes and co-workers published a systematic investigation on the effect of size, concentration, and  pore stability of nonporous and porous silica nanoparticles toward the hemolysis of RBCs. The authors found that all the nonporous and porous silica nanoparticles showed concentration- and size-dependent hemolytic activity  on RBCs, with exception of the smallest MSNs. In addition, the porous order and stability also influence the hemolytic activity of MSNs. The authors reported that **pore collapse of MSNs lead to greatly increased hemolytic activity**. Further work is necessary to improve the stability and surface-functionalized MSNs to avoid this hemolytic effects.  

Applications of MSNs in vivo have been recently reported, which can give us some preliminary insight into their  toxicological performance. For instance, D.-M. Huang, T. Hyeon, W. Lin, and co-workers have demonstrated the   use of MSNs as bioimaging vehicles in vivo. These authors used different amounts of material per kilogram of  animal: 200 mg kg^(-1) (Huang), 100–150 mg kg^(-1) (Hyeon), and 10–110 mg kg^(-1) (Lin). At these concentrations, **none of the authors observed toxic effects in vivo in the short-term**. In addition, T. Hyeon and co-workers  followed the biodistribution of the material 24hs after intravenous injection; they found that MSNs accumulated mainly in the liver, kidney, and spleen."

"As was mentioned before, the in vitro studies have previously shown that the biocompatibility of MSNs is  concentration- and cell-type-dependent. In the case of the in vivo experiments, the authors selected three  different routes of administration: **subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous**. The subcutaneous  administration did not show significant toxicity after a long-term investigation on rats (3 months), even though high doses of MSNs were introduced (75 mg kg^(-1)). In the case of peritoneal administration, the authors found  that the material is lethal to SV129 mice during the first 24hs post injection when injecting 1.2 g kg^(-1) of  material, but decreasing the dose to 40 mg kg^(-1) or less resulted in significant reduction of the toxicity.  The same lethal effect as in the peritoneal injection was observed on the intravenous administration with a  high concentration of MSNs (1.2 g kg^(-1)). The authors hypothesized that this toxicity may be due to pulmonary embolism and/or thrombosis, but the death mechanism is still under investigation. It is important to mention  that due to the chemical versatility of MSNs for further functionalization, the toxicity at high concentrations  of this material in vivo could be mitigated using polymers, liposomes, proteins, and/or other functional groups as has been suggested by different authors.

Another important concern for the application of MSNs as drug delivery nanocarrier is the ability of safely  degrading this material under physiological conditions after it has accomplished its diagnostic/therapeutic  function. The ideal situation would be that this material could be biologically degraded into harmless byproducts, and finally cleared from the animal body through a safe route. Recently two studies related to this issue have been published. The authors reported on the degradability and clearance of silicon and silica materials in vivo. They found that the accumulation of the material is mainly in the mononuclear phagocytic  system organs, such as the kidney, liver, and spleen. A noticeable silicon clearance  was  observed from the mice body within a period of one week, and the material was completely cleared in four weeks. The porous silicon nanoparticles did not show any considerable toxicity to the mice organs and their growth was similar to the  control. 

The biodistribution and elimination of silica nanoparticles was also studied. These nanoparticles accumulated  mainly in the liver, kidney, and urinary bladder after a few hours of being administrated through an intravenous  injection. It was also reported that the blood circulation time can be modified by coating the nanoparticles with different functional groups. Finally, the authors demonstrated that the silica nanoparticles are safely excreted through a renal route."

## Drug Delivery

"The development of MSNs as both gene and drug delivery systems was published. This nanocarrier contained the MSNs as the scaffold and PAMAM dendrimers as caps. Taking advantage of the positive charge of the PAMAM dendrimers, the intracellular release of the plasmid DNA that encodes for an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was demonstrated. **The protection of DNA from enzymatic cleavage by PAMAM-MSNs vehicle was confirmed**.  Interestingly, the gene transfection efficacy was better than commercially available transfection agents. This  demonstrated the ability of MSNs to carry, protect, transfer, and release DNA vectors inside the cells."

# Conclusions

"Some of the endocytic and trafficking mechanisms have been described, but still some questions have to be answered in the near future. For example, the last stage of MSNs in the cells is unknown; two possible answers  for this question can be envisioned: exocytosis or biodegradation. In the case of the MSN-based target-specific  nanovehicles, encouraging results have been obtained in vitro, but these systems have not been applied in vivo and therefore their complete success is still questionable. 

The most recent reports on the toxicity of MSN materials in vivo have shown promising results. However, **much  more work needs to be performed to demonstrate the biocompatibility of MSNs in vivo**. In addition, due to the versatility to further functionalize MSNs, we believe that better systems can be developed to overcome any toxicological issue."
