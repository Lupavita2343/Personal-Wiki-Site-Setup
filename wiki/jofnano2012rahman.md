## Summary of "Synthesis of Silica Nanoparticles by Sol-Gel: Size-Dependent Properties, Surface Modification, and Applications in Silica-Polymer Nanocomposites — A Review"

# Introduction and synthesis

**Note: There is a lot of technical chem content.**

"Advancement in nanotechnology has led to the production of nanosized silica, SiO2,which has been widely used as filler in engineering composite. The silica particles extracted from natural resources contains metal impurities and not favorable for advanced scientific and industrial applications. Thus, focus is given to synthetic silica. This paper will focus on the aspect of synthesis, size-dependent properties, and surface modification of nanosilica toward preparation of nanocomposites, generally by sol-gel." 

*Synthesis*

"In synthesis of silica nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be grown inside the microcavities by carefully controlling the addition of silicon alkoxides and catalyst into the medium containing reverse micelles. **The major drawbacks of the reverse microemulsion approach are high cost and difficulties in removal of surfactants in the final products.** However, the method was successfully applied for the coating of nanoparticles with different functional groups for various applications.

Silica nanoparticles can also be produced through high temperature flame decomposition of metal-organic precursors. **Difficulty in controlling the particle size, morphology, and phase composition is the main disadvantage of the flame synthesis.** Nevertheless, this is the prominent method that has been used to commercially produce silica nanoparticles in powder form."

*There's a detailed explanation of the sol-gel process with technical chem content*

"A pioneer work on the synthesis of spherical and monodispersed silica particles was reported by St ̈ober et al.[14]Silica particles with the size ranging from 5 to 2000 nm from aqueous alcohol solutions of silica alkoxides in presence of ammonia as catalyst (basic condition) have been produced. Following that many contemporary research works describing the synthesis of nanosilica particles are indeed evolved from the St ̈ober method. The main advantage of St ̈ober method is the ability to form monodispersed spherical silica particles compared to the acid-catalyzed systems which usually result gel structures."

**Optimization of Reaction Conditions** 

"An optimized synthesis condition is a combination of optimal values of each reaction parameter of sol-gel method that could produce smallest, homogenous, and monodispersed silica nanoparticles. 

- In principle, smaller nanoparticles are obtained by controlling (slowing down) the rate of polycondensation reactions through manipulation of reaction parameters. **Most of the works agreed that the particle size increased with increase in ammonia concentrations.**

- The addition of small amount of anion electrolyte additives (ammonium salts of Br, I, and Cl) produced monodispersed silica particles ∼20 nm to ∼34 nm depending on the anions used. 

- By fixing concentration of reactants and temperature, **the particle size and particle distribution of silica nanoparticle were highly dependent on mixing modes.** Mode-A has produced monodispersed powder with average particles size of ∼10 nm. The use of freeze dryer has further improved the quality of powder."

**Drying and Agglomeration Phenomena**

"Drying is a simple process which involves fluid to solid transition leading to the formation of solid materials. Supercritical drying, freeze drying, spray drying, and thermal drying are some of the common techniques used to produce particulate solid materials from the liquid phase. Collision and coalescence of the nanoparticles are the main factors that govern the extent of agglomeration in a nanoparticles powder system. Also, the intense ageing process that occurs during the drying of sol can lead to complex agglomeration behavior arising from polycondensation reactions. In addition, the polycondensation reactions between the silanol groups have been reported to increase in presence of water and catalyst.

**A careful controlled drying process leads to the formation of well-dispersed particles, whereas drying in the presence of water can result in agglomeration phenomena**. In preparation of silica-polymer nanocomposite, the presence of agglomerates can significantly reduce the silica loading, resulting in reduced thermochemical properties. **However, works on controlling the agglomeration of nanosilica via effective drying process are lacking**"

Some things they **do** know:

- Agglomeration of nanoparticles during drying process could be effectively reduced by using ethanol as the suspension medium.

- Rahman and coworkers have described the effect of alcohol dehydration, freeze drying, and oven drying
techniques on the size, size distribution, dispersion, and agglomeration of ∼7 nm nanosilica produced by sol-gel. The results revealed that **alcohol dehydration was an effective technique to produce silica nanoparticles with improved dispersion and reduced agglomeration**.

**Size-Dependent Properties of Silica Nanoparticles**

"The properties of nanomaterials are usually size dependent. The nanomaterial often exhibits unique physical and chemical properties compared to the bulk counterparts."

- *Physiochemical Properties* The amount of atoms residing on the surface increases with the decrease in particle size. For silica nanoparticles smaller than 5 nm, more than half of the Si atoms are present on the surface. Thus, the surface should have one or more silanol groups. The concentration of silanol groups increases with the decrease in the particles size which is interrelated to the specific surface
area. However, the silanol number decrease with the decrease in the particle size suggests that these nanoparticles could be chemically reactive, therefore suitable for catalyst applications.

- *Thermal and Mechanical Properties* Nanosize powderswere found to compact easily, and the sintering temperature also significantly reduced compared to the conventional microsize powders. Besides, ceramic nanoparticles also exhibit reduced brittleness and enhanced ductility.

- *Optical Properties* Silica nanoparticles have been widely studied owing to several interesting optical phenomena caused by point defects generated from any defect imperfect SiO4 continuous network, including oxygen and silicon vacancies. These point defects can also be divided into two groups: paramagnetic and diamagnetic. Paramagnetic defects have optical absorption which represents half-occupied energy level in the optical band gap. Thus, hole transition or electron transition to the valence band is possible. Diamagnetic defects have absorption band associated with electron
transition to the conduction band. These defects and their combination are able to exhibit diversity of absorption and PL bands in broad range of wavelength, near-infrared, visible, and ultraviolet (UV). Hence, optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) become two useful tools for monitoring optical changes resulting from structural defect at the nanoparticle bulk and surface.

# Silica-Filled Polymer Nanocomposites

"One of the prominent applications of silica nanoparticles is as fillers or reinforcement in advanced composite materials. Chemical modifications of silica (filler) surface and effective mixing method are two main routes that can lead to homogenous filler distribution. The following sections briefly review the important aspects of silica-polymer nanocomposites, as stated above, such as chemical modification of silica surface, the preparation method for nanocomposites, and the effect of silica nanoparticles on the properties of nanocomposites."

**Chemical Modification of Silica Surface**

"The surface modifications have been reported to enhance the affinity between the organic and inorganic phases and at the same time improve the dispersion of silica nanoparticles within the polymer matrix.

Modification of silica surface with silane coupling agents is one of the most effective techniques available. Silane coupling agents (Si(OR)3R') have the ability to bond inorganic materials such as silica nanoparticles to organic resins.

Surface modification of silica nanoparticles can be carried out by using various types of silane coupling agents such as aminopropylmethydiethoxy silane (APMDS) and methacryloxypropyltriethoxysilane
(MPTS) via nonaqueous and aqueous route. A slight increase in the particle size (∼25%) after the surface modification was observed.

The treatment of nanosilica by epoxy silane with a longer reaction time and lower silane concentrations assisted with pretreatment by sonication can achieve monodispersed silica in polar medium. Both modification reactions were conducted via aqueous route. It was reported that the epoxy
silane wasmore effective in dispersing the silica nanoparticles compared to the amino silanes due to the absence of hydrogen bonding between the particles. The irreversible aggregation of silica nanoparticles in colloidal form can be controlled by keeping the trimethoxysilane to silica ratio low whilemixing and reacting the two slowly or by using monomethoxysilane as the aminosilane
surface modifying agent.

Although numerous of cocondensation modification methods have been reported for porous silica, the modification of silica nanoparticles has been less investigated"

**Methods for Dispersing Silica Nanoparticles in Polymer Matrix**

"A homogenous dispersion of nanofillers via melt mixing process is still a challenging aspect in the preparation of polymer composite materials. Intense particle-particle attractions at nanoscale and the presence of monomers and curing agents in solid form at room temperature require effective dispersion techniques."

**Applications of Nanosilica in Polymer Nanocomposites**

"Silica nanoparticle reinforcement in certain polymer matrixes can lead to significant property
improvements, whereas in others they only provide marginal property improvements or in some cases worsening of the properties. As an example, Kang et al. found that the incorporation of 400nm silica particles into epoxy resulted in almost 13% increase in the Tg and the damping behavior (tan δ) of the composite decreased with the increase in the filler content. These phenomena have been attributed to the addition of rigid silica nanoparticle which made the polymer difficult to move.

Preghenella et al. found an immonotonous variation in the thermomechanical properties of fumed silica filled epoxy composite with respect to the filler content. The Tg was found decreased up to 27% as the filler content was increased from 0 to 20 phr. However, the Tg was found increased at 30 phr of silica content. In another work, Zhang et al., based on the DSC kinetic studies, found
that the polyacrylamide- (PAAM-) modified silica nanoparticles slightly enhance the cure reactions of epoxy. Contrary effect was found for nonmodified silica nanoparticles. This interesting findings show that the silica nanoparticles not only influence the thermal mechanical properties of the
nanocomposite but also play a part in the polymerization reactions of the polymer matrix, in some cases."

**Filler-Matrix Interactions**

"The interaction at the interface between the nanofillers and matrix is the most important factor that controls the resulting properties of the nanocomposite. **A strong interface between the filler and matrix can be achieved through surface modification that leads to significantly reduced filler agglomeration**. The SEM analysis showed that the pure silica nanoparticles present as large aggregates in the epoxy matrix. Significant improvement in the dispersion was achieved by modifying the silica surface with epoxide functional groups. Ragosta et al. found that the epoxy
groups reacted with the silanol groups present on the silica surface, leading to an increased interfacial adhesion. The strong interfacial adhesion increased the fracture toughness
of silica-epoxy nanocomposite compared to the neat epoxy. Zhang et al. found an enhanced wear resistance in the silica-epoxy nanocomposite prepared from polyacrylamide- (PAAM-) modified silica nanoparticles. This enhancement was attributed to the covalent bonding between the PAAM-modified
silica and epoxy matrix.

The strong surface interaction at the filler-polymer interface is related to the formation immobilized amorphous layer of polymer molecules on the nanoparticles. The thickness
of the layer depends on the degree of dispersion, size, and types of nanofillers but independent from their shapes that resulted in unique properties of nanocomposites. Thus, the use of nanosize fillers offers a great benefit to the nanocomposites compared to the traditional composites."
