## Summary of "Synthesis of Silica Nanoparticles by Sol-Gel: Size-Dependent Properties, Surface Modification, and Applications in Silica-Polymer Nanocomposites — A Review"

# Introduction and synthesis

**Note: There is a lot of technical chem content.**

"Advancement in nanotechnology has led to the production of nanosized silica, SiO2,which has been widely used as filler in engineering composite. The silica particles extracted from natural resources contains metal impurities and not favorable for advanced scientific and industrial applications. Thus, focus is given to synthetic silica. This paper will focus on the aspect of synthesis, size-dependent properties, and surface modification of nanosilica toward preparation of nanocomposites, generally by sol-gel." 

*Synthesis*

"In synthesis of silica nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be grown inside the microcavities by carefully controlling the addition of silicon alkoxides and catalyst into the medium containing reverse micelles. **The major drawbacks of the reverse microemulsion approach are high cost and difficulties in removal of surfactants in the final products.** However, the method was successfully applied for the coating of nanoparticles with different functional groups for various applications.

Silica nanoparticles can also be produced through high temperature flame decomposition of metal-organic precursors. **Difficulty in controlling the particle size, morphology, and phase composition is the main disadvantage of the flame synthesis.** Nevertheless, this is the prominent method that has been used to commercially produce silica nanoparticles in powder form."

*There's a detailed explanation of the sol-gel process with technical chem content*

"A pioneer work on the synthesis of spherical and monodispersed silica particles was reported by St ̈ober et al.[14]Silica particles with the size ranging from 5 to 2000 nm from aqueous alcohol solutions of silica alkoxides in presence of ammonia as catalyst (basic condition) have been produced. Following that many contemporary research works describing the synthesis of nanosilica particles are indeed evolved from the St ̈ober method. The main advantage of St ̈ober method is the ability to form monodispersed spherical silica particles compared to the acid-catalyzed systems which usually result gel structures."

**Optimization of Reaction Conditions** 

"An optimized synthesis condition is a combination of optimal values of each reaction parameter of sol-gel method that could produce smallest, homogenous, and monodispersed silica nanoparticles. 

- In principle, smaller nanoparticles are obtained by controlling (slowing down) the rate of polycondensation reactions through manipulation of reaction parameters. **Most of the works agreed that the particle size increased with increase in ammonia concentrations.**

- The addition of small amount of anion electrolyte additives (ammonium salts of Br, I, and Cl) produced monodispersed silica particles ∼20 nm to ∼34 nm depending on the anions used. 

- By fixing concentration of reactants and temperature, **the particle size and particle distribution of silica nanoparticle were highly dependent on mixing modes.** Mode-A has produced monodispersed powder with average particles size of ∼10 nm. The use of freeze dryer has further improved the quality of powder.
