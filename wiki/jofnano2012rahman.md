## Summary of "Synthesis of Silica Nanoparticles by Sol-Gel: Size-Dependent Properties, Surface Modification, and Applications in Silica-Polymer Nanocomposites â€” A Review"

# Introduction and synthesis

**Note: There is a lot of technical chem content.**

"Advancement in nanotechnology has led to the production of nanosized silica, SiO2,which has been widely used as filler in engineering composite. The silica particles extracted from natural resources contains metal impurities and not favorable for advanced scientific and industrial applications. Thus, focus is given to synthetic silica. This paper will focus on the aspect of synthesis, size-dependent properties, and surface modification of nanosilica toward preparation of nanocomposites, generally by sol-gel." 

*Synthesis*

"In synthesis of silica nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be grown inside the microcavities by carefully controlling the addition of silicon alkoxides and catalyst into the medium containing reverse micelles. **The major drawbacks of the reverse microemulsion approach are high cost and difficulties in removal of surfactants in the final products.** However, the method was successfully applied for the coating of nanoparticles with different functional groups for various applications.

Silica nanoparticles can also be produced through high temperature flame decomposition of metal-organic precursors. **Difficulty in controlling the particle size, morphology, and phase composition is the main disadvantage of the flame synthesis.** Nevertheless, this is the prominent method that has been used to commercially produce silica nanoparticles in powder form.
