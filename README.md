# Personal Wiki and Static Blog Site Setup

This is a template for my personal site, made with GitHub pages. 

It uses jekyll, and comes with all the features you need to set up your personal wiki and blog.

## Forking this repo

If you want to build your own personal wiki / personal site using mine as a template, all you have to do is:

- Fork this repo.
- Set up the values in `_config.yml` for your twitter username and Google Analytics ID.
- In the folder `wiki` you can put your own markdown notes, setting them with a title, tags and description. Use the example template as reference.
- Markdowns in the `_posts` folder it follow the same format, but their names must start with a date in format YYYY-MM-DD.
- Go to `_layouts` to see the HTML templates for each page kind. You can fiddle around with them.
- Customize `wiki/index.html`, the `index.html` on base directory (homepage) and `about/index.md`, as they are supposed to contain a personal description. Also update the social networking links on `_layouts/default.html`'s footer so they point to your networks. These include support for fontawesome icons. In that footer is also a path to the default twitter image, though each article or post can have its own image (specified in header).
- To change up the style, just edit `css/main.css` and run `minify_css.sh` to minify (or change the default layout to import the unminified css instead). You can find many good CSS templates that are free in this [Free Jekyll Themes Gallery](https://jekyllthemes.io/free).

To run the site locally, run

```
sudo gem install rails
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
cd ~/this_project

bundle init
bundle install
bundle add jekyll
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- `git status -s` : See git current status.
- `git add *filenames` : tell git a file should be tracked and has changes.
- `git commit -m 'some description'` : Persist the changes added since the last commit
- `git push origin` : Transfer all commits to productive site.
